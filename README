Plugin for implementation of JIRA multiselect field with aui select2 renderer
by implementing new customfield type

base functions are working properly now. field is being rendered and pics a
values

everything that was necessary to accomplish that - correct pom.xml and
atlassian-plugin.xml from atlassian tutorial (it was incomplete and outdated),
implement main class with inherits from superclasses without overriding any
methods, and develop proper velocity template to make multiselect custom field
look like versions or labels jira standard fields
